\title{Resolve overlaps in ROI data by slide}
\usage{
resolve_roi_overlaps(roi_data, scale_factor = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{roi_data}{Data frame with ROI definitions (output from cycif_load_roi_data)}

\item{scale_factor}{Scale factor for coordinate conversion (default 1.0)}
}
\value{
An sf object with resolved ROI polygons, preserving slideName and metadata
}
\description{
Takes ROI data (output from cycif_load_roi_data) and resolves overlapping
polygons for each slide separately. Converts ROI data to sf format, resolves
overlaps using Voronoi-based splitting, and returns a combined sf object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load ROI data and resolve overlaps
roi_data <- cycif_load_roi_data("/path/to/rois")
resolved_rois <- resolve_roi_overlaps(roi_data)
}
