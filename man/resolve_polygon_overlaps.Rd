\title{Resolve overlaps between polygons by splitting them}
\usage{
resolve_polygon_overlaps(polygon_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygon_df}{A dataframe or sf object containing ROI polygons, like
the output from \code{cycif_load_roi_data()}.}
}
\value{
An sf object with overlaps resolved
}
\description{
Takes a list of polygons and resolves pairwise overlaps by splitting the
overlapping regions. Only handles cases where at most two polygons overlap.
The overlaps are resolved iteratively using Voronoi-based splitting lines.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Resolve overlaps in a set of ROI polygons
resolved_polygons <- resolve_polygon_overlaps(roi_sf)
}
}
