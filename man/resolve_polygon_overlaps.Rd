\title{Resolve overlaps between polygons by splitting them}
\usage{
resolve_polygon_overlaps(polygon_sf, max_iterations = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygon_sf}{An sf object containing POLYGON geometries}

\item{max_iterations}{Maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops
(default 100)}
}
\value{
An sf object with overlaps resolved
}
\description{
Takes a list of polygons and resolves pairwise overlaps by splitting the
overlapping regions. Only handles cases where at most two polygons overlap
(no three-way overlaps). The overlaps are resolved iteratively using
Voronoi-based splitting lines.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Resolve overlaps in a set of ROI polygons
resolved_polygons <- resolve_polygon_overlaps(roi_sf)
}
